Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Traffic Violation Detection System 🚦🚗
Are you ready to dive into the world of AI-driven traffic violation detection? With just a few easy steps, you’ll have this exciting project up and running. Let’s get started!

🔧 Step 1: Install Anaconda
Before diving into the code, ensure you have Anaconda installed on your system. Anaconda simplifies the process of managing environments and packages!

🛠️ Step 2: Update the Path
In the project code, locate the following line:
python file
find = "C:/Your Path/Traffic Violation Detection"
Replace it with the path where you stored the project folder. For example
python file
find = "C:/Coding/Projects/Traffic Violation Detection"

📂 Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the folder where you have the project stored. You can do this by running:
bash
cd path_to_your_project_directory

🖥️ Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment
Let’s set up a dedicated environment for this project! Run the following command to create a virtual environment with Python 3.8:
bash
Copy code
conda create --name Vplatform python=3.8

🚀 Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate your virtual environment with this simple command:
bash
Copy code
conda activate Vplatform

📦 Step 6: Install Required Packages
Time to install the necessary packages that power the project:
bash
Copy code
conda install pillow
conda install numpy
conda install keras
conda install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install imageio
pip install imageio[ffmpeg]
pip install imageio[pyav]

⚡ Step 7: Run the Project
Now, you’re ready to run the project! Simply execute the following command:
bash
Copy code
python Run Project.py

🖼️ Step 8: Select the Input File
When the project GUI appears, select the image or video file that you want to analyze for traffic violations.

✏️ Step 9: Set the Detection Boundary
Mark the boundary in the GUI where the detection system should monitor violations.

⏳ Step 10: Wait for the Magic!
Sit back and watch as the system processes the input and provides you with real-time detection results!

💡 Pro Tip: For faster execution, you can use better YOLO weights. Explore the web for optimized YOLO weight files to improve the performance of your detection system!
